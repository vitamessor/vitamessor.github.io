	<p class="lead">Hello! I'm Elizabeth Ozimek-Newman, a Computer Engineering student at the <a href="http://www.ece.ucf.edu/">University of Central Florida</a>.</p>
	<p>Whilst between classes, I spend my time working on projects, studying, designing new sites and graphics, and making grilled cheese sandwiches. I'm also a member of the<a href="http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~acm/"> Association of Computing Machinery</a> at UCF and spend a good majority of my time designing graphics for them or helping to plan events.</p>
	
	<p>Please feel free to <a href="contact">contact me</a> if you would like to work with me on a project or simply would like to get to know me. </p>
