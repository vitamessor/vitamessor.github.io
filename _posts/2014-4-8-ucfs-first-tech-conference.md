title: UCF’s First Tech Conference
---
In the beginning of January, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at the University of Central Florida (UCF) began planning its first large-scale tech conference, which was scheduled to occur mid-March. As one of the three member of the Event Planning Committee, I was heavily involved in the planning. However, six weeks before the conference, with little planning actually accomplished, the individual in charge of the committee was forced to resign, due to unforeseen circumstances. I volunteered to take her place as the interim Event Coordinator and was awarded the position. 

The next six weeks were truly a blur of madness and insanity as we considered and reconsidered catering options, filled out paperwork, tried to find parking options, designed and redesigned layout and pamphlets, and advertised like hell for it. Thankfully, I had the support  of the officers and multiple members of the club who volunteered and showed up to the meeting we held twice a week.

About three weeks before the conference, I had finished the design for the posters and  and had printed them at Staples, using my own money to pay for the printing. THis was because I was unaware that there were printing labs on campus, where I could go and get them printed for free. To the situation even worse, Career Services contacted us that day, offering their advice and requesting that we, instead of calling the career fair a “Career Fair”, we instead refer to it as a “Company Showcase”. Not only could I have printed the posters for free, but the ones I had already printed were completely useless because of the large letters “CAREER FAIR” printed on the front. Now that its over, I look back and find the situation to be quite humorous. Let’s just say that I was well supplied with scratch paper for the rest of the month. 

I noticed, as well as many others, that as the conference approached, my notes of topics that I wanted to cover in our meetings became increasingly more ridiculous.  In the beginning, all of my notes were clear and understandable.  ![Normal Thoughts]({{eaon.me}}/img/posts/1.jpg)
However, within the last week before the conference, my notes became more and more… interesting. During the meeting that was held two days before the conference, I noticed the trend and added the observation to the document, as seen below. Below are more examples that I found to be quite funny as I read back through them.

When the day of the conference came around, I am proud to say that it was successful. Over 200 students attended. We held a panel discussion in which both industry professionals and professors discussed the relationship between a computer science education and a career as a software engineer. After the panel, we held a two hour career fair, allowing students and company representatives to interact directly. The career fair was followed by an hour long lunch of Qdoba for the companies, and pizza for the the students. We concluded the event with 2 hours of tech talks, allowing students to choose which of the four tech talks, during each hour long block, to attend. I am also proud to say that we hosted a wide range of companies. While we had large companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Lockheed Martin, attend, we also hosted smaller companies, like Sentry Data Systems, Precision Infinity, and IZEA, as well. 

On a more serious note, the amount of stress was overwhelming, and I will honestly say that it affected my grades. However, I feel as if I truly benefitted from this experience. I learned how to delegate and work with a large group of people towards a larger goal. I grew because of this experience and learned management skills. I learned how to plan something of this caliber and I am proud to say that I planned ACM at UCF’s first Tech Conference.
